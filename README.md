# Leaf-gathering-using-Image-Processing

This is a Python program for detecting leaves and determining their quantity in an image or video in pixels.

To detect the leaves, I relied on their distinct color and used the OpenCV library. 

For the detection of the quantity of leaves, I based it on the number of pixels that represent the detected color on the camera plane.

However, there were constraints in detecting the leaves because the color depends on the brightness of the ground.
