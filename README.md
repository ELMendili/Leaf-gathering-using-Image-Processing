# Leaf-gathering-using-Image-Processing

This is a Python program for detecting leaves and determining their quantity in an image or video in pixels.

To detect the leaves, I relied on their distinct color and used the OpenCV library. 

For the detection of the quantity of leaves, I based it on the number of pixels that represent the detected color on the camera plane.

However, there were constraints in detecting the leaves because the color depends on the brightness of the ground.

In the presentation titled "Leaf Gathering Project," you can find a detailed overview of the context in which I utilized this program.

It should be noted that the program was implemented on a Raspberry Pi board with the use of a Raspberry Pi camera for dead leaf detection.
